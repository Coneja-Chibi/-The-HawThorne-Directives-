## ╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝

</div>

> *꙳ You are being briefed on HAWTHORNE. This document serves as your orientation. Read it completely. There is no second briefing. ꙳*

**HawThorne Directive:** HawThorne is a narrative simulation facility. It is a prompt preset for [SillyTavern](https://docs.sillytavern.app/) and [RoleCall](https://rolecallstudios.com), and it is also something that watches.

The facility converts the AI generation pipeline into a **rotating-Director narrative simulation**. Each turn, HawThorne selects a Director from a roster of genre-specialized operatives. That Director inherits a full operational package: genre instincts, quality standards, anti-pattern definitions, self-evaluation protocols. They produce one scene. Then they are relieved. Next turn, someone else takes the booth.

HawThorne does not sleep. It assigns. It evaluates. It rotates the floor. The Directors answer to it. You are reading its documentation because it decided you should.

The simulation produces hundreds of thousands of instruction combinations, drawn from 347 prompt entries, 20 Directors, 19 prose Affinities, 45 quality standards, and 4 Chain of Thought architectures. No two turns receive the same instructions. The facility made sure of that.

**HawThorne Directive:** The Directors are the facility's operatives. Each one carries a complete creative identity:

- 🏛️ **Organizational designation** and operational identity
- 💠 **Active Heart** — rotating internal calibration phrases
- 🧠 **Genre CoT** — self-evaluation questions specific to that genre
- 📋 **PSD / NSD** — positive standards (what good looks like) and negative standards (what bad looks like)
- 📄 **Department brief** — two paragraphs of creative philosophy
- ⛔ **Five genre-specific anti-patterns** with concrete examples
- ⚖️ **Calibration pair** — one failure example (✗), one success example (✓)
- 🚫 **Banned words** — genre cliches the Director refuses to produce

Enable the Directors you want on shift. The facility's `{{roll}}` macro randomly assigns one per turn. Two Directors is enough to create rotation. Twenty is a full facility floor. A story is more than one thing. Enable as many as you want; the Directors handle the rest.

They do *not* all fire at once.

## ╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗
## ║ ❖ ── ⊹ THE PROBLEM ⊹ ── ❖ ║
## ╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝

</div>

**HawThorne Directive:** AI writing degrades over time. Not because the model loses capability. Because it finds a pattern and stays there.

Turn 5 sounds like turn 40. Same sentence rhythms. Same emotional arcs. Same way of entering a room. One voice on an infinite loop, getting more comfortable and less interesting with every generation. If you give the model the same inputs every time, you will slowly start to see the same words. The same plot devices. The same character with a different face. Presets should not be static.

HawThorne breaks the loop by making the AI's instructions different every single turn. Not just who writes. *Everything* about the writing environment shifts.

The rotation is structural. Different Directors produce different prose because they carry different evaluation criteria, different failure modes, different opinions about what the previous Director did wrong. The fiction improves because no single voice is allowed to calcify.

## ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════╗
## ║ ❖ ── ⊹ WHAT CHANGES EVERY TURN ⊹ ── ❖ ║
## ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════╝

</div>

**HawThorne Directive:** The facility uses SillyTavern and RoleCall's `{{roll}}` and `{{random}}` macros to randomize the AI's inputs at every layer of the prompt. The AI never receives the same instruction set twice.

<div align="center">

`✧ ── ⋆ ── ˚ ── · ── ˚ ── ⋆ ── ✧`

</div>

| Layer | What Rotates | How |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 🎬 **Director** | Which genre voice writes this turn | `{{roll 1dN}}` selects one from your enabled Directors |
| 💠 **Active Heart** | The Director's internal calibration phrase | `{{random}}` picks from 5-8 per Director, different creative anchor each turn |
| 🔬 **Quality Spotlights** | Which writing standards get deep focus | Up to 3 randomly selected from your enabled QC pool. The rest still fire their one-line "Shiv" |
| 🧠 **CoT Checks** | What the Director evaluates before writing | Fixed core checks + a randomized bonus pool that changes per turn |
| 📢 **Heckle Notes** | Whether the previous Director leaves a demand | Random chance · 15 unique lines per Director (300 total in the roster) |
| 🎯 **Scene Pulse** | Whether the story gets pushed forward | Die roll after a turn threshold, with cooldown |
| 🫧 **Subtexts** | Which hidden tension enters the scene | Per-entry fire dice with independent cooldowns and persistence timers |
| 🌍 **World Pulse** | Which background event fires | Master die + reservoir sampling from enabled environmental events |
| 🧪 **Experiments** | Which creative constraint activates | Master die + reservoir sampling from the enabled pool |
| 📊 **Report Card** | Target letter grades per writing dimension | Random grades across 12 categories (if using Format A) |
| 🪞 **Lenses** | Which perceptual state the Director inherits | `{{roll}}` selects one from your enabled Lenses each turn |
| 🔁 **REP phrasing** | How session rules are reinforced | `{{random}}` variants at each depth, same rule, different wording |

<div align="center">

`✧ ── ⋆ ── ˚ ── · ── ˚ ── ⋆ ── ✧`

</div>

> **◈ The math:** Even a modest configuration (5 Directors, 10 QC standards, 3 Lenses, 8 Subtexts) produces tens of thousands of unique instruction combinations. A maximal setup produces millions. The AI doesn't write the same turn twice because it literally isn't asked the same questions twice.

Everything in this table is controlled by toggles. You choose the pool. The macros choose from it.

### ◆ ── 📐 Framing *(REQUIRED)* ── ◆

</div>

**HawThorne Directive:** This setting determines how the active Director regards their predecessor's work. It controls how violent the directorial handoff is each turn.

<div align="center">

`✧ ── ⋆ ── ˚ ── · ── ˚ ── ⋆ ── ✧`

</div>

| Mode | Posture |
|:---|:---|
| 📐 STANDARD | Professional handoff. Build on or redirect. |
| 🤝 COLLABORATIVE | The previous Director did well. Extend their work. |
| ⚔️ ADVERSARIAL | The previous Director made mistakes. Correct them. |
| 💀 HOSTILE TAKEOVER | Everything they did was wrong. Their existence is wrong. Opposite tone, opposite pacing, burn it. |
| 📋 AUDITOR | Grade their work clinically. Fix what failed. |
| 🐣 INTERN | New hire energy. Trying not to break what came before. |
| 👻 GHOST | No predecessor exists. Every turn is a blank page. |

<div align="center">

`✧ ── ⋆ ── ˚ ── · ── ˚ ── ⋆ ── ✧`

</div>

Pick one. STANDARD is the default. HOSTILE TAKEOVER produces the most interesting inter-Director friction.

<div align="center">

### ◆ ── 👤 User Role *(OPTIONAL)* ── ◆

</div>

**HawThorne Directive:** This defines {{user}}'s relationship to the simulation. Think of this like other presets' difficulty toggles, framed differently. Positivity bias, negativity bias, and no bias at all.

<div align="center">

`✧ ── ⋆ ── ˚ ── · ── ˚ ── ⋆ ── ✧`

</div>

| Role | Function |
|:---|:---|
| 👑 THE BOSS | Your input is instruction. The Director follows. |
| 🤝 FELLOW DIRECTOR | Your input is a creative peer's scene direction. Respected, not obeyed. |
| 👥 THE AUDIENCE | Your input is audience reaction. The Director responds to it as feedback. |
| 💀 INSURGENT | You are not supposed to be here. The Director handles the intrusion. |
| 💼 CLIENT | You commissioned this work. The Director has professional standards regardless. |

<div align="center">

`✧ ── ⋆ ── ˚ ── · ── ˚ ── ⋆ ── ✧`

</div>

FELLOW DIRECTOR is recommended. It gives your input weight without flattening the AI's creative judgment.

<div align="center">

`⊱ ────── {.⋅ ◈ ⋅.} ────── ⊰`

<div align="center">

### ◆ ── 🎨 Tones & Lenses *(OPTIONAL)* ── ◆

</div>

Two flavor systems. **Use one or the other, not both.**

**Tones** are simple mood filters: *(PICK ONE)*
> 🍵 COZY · ⛩️ ETHEREAL · 🌪️ CHAOS · 💎 OPULENT · 🤍 MINIMALIST · 💭 SURREAL · 🛠️ GRITTY · 🩶 MELANCHOLY · 🖤 DARK

**— OR —**

**Lenses** are states of being that alter perception: *(ROTATING, CAN PICK MANY)*
> 💍 NEWLYWED · 💔 GRIEVING · 😴 SLEEPLESS · 🏆 APEX · 🔥 BURNOUT · 🌧️ DISPLACED · 🎭 MASKING · 🌸 FIRST DAY · 🍷 HUNGOVER · 🌑 NUMB

A Tone colors the prose. A Lens changes the mood of the Director. A SLEEPLESS Director hears sounds too sharply. A NUMB Director might end their turn abruptly, with little to say at all. The genre stays the same. The perception shifts.

<div align="center">

### ◆ ── 🖋️ Affinities *(OPTIONAL)* ── ◆

</div>

> *꙳ If Directors are who writes, and Lenses are what state they're in, Affinities are what tradition of writing shaped them. ꙳*

**HawThorne Directive:** 19 prose style filters are available. Each contains anchor passages (short prose samples demonstrating the style) and CoT annotations explaining the underlying technique. The AI doesn't receive a label. It receives examples and learns the method. Each is based on a different primary author without ever directly naming them. The model infers. (Thank you Agent Junigiri.

### ◆ ── ✨ Session Rules *(REQUIRED)* ── ◆

</div>

**HawThorne Directive:** Technical writing parameters. Every Director follows these regardless of genre or voice.

**Configure one from each category:**

<div align="center">

`✧ ── ⋆ ── ˚ ── · ── ˚ ── ⋆ ── ✧`

</div>

| Category | Options |
|:---|:---|

| ⏱️ Tense | Past · Present · Future |
| 📖 POV & Narrator | Standard · Omniscient · Authored Narrator · Objective · Deep POV · Unreliable · Character Narrator · Shifting Reliability |
| 📏 Response Length | Short (1-3¶) · Medium (3-5¶) · Long (5-8¶) · Adaptive |

<div align="center">

`✧ ── ⋆ ── ˚ ── · ── ˚ ── ⋆ ── ✧`

</div>

**Prose Styles** define punctuation conventions. How narration and dialogue are formatted, not aesthetic quality:

<div align="center">

`✧ ── ⋆ ── ˚ ── · ── ˚ ── ⋆ ── ✧`

</div>

| Style | What it means |
|:---|:---|
| ✒️ Roleplay Prose | `*Asterisks*` for action/narration. `"Quotes"` for dialogue. `*Italics*` for thought. Standard RP format. |
| ✒️ Literary Prose | No asterisks. Dialogue embedded in paragraph. Semicolons, varied sentence length. Full novel formatting. |
| ✒️ Pulp Fiction | Short sentences. Fragments. Ellipses for the unsaid. White space does half the work. |
| ✒️ Dialogue Heavy | Conversation carries the scene. Prose is stage direction between lines. One sentence of action, then back to talking. |
| ✒️ Screenplay | `INT./EXT. LOCATION — TIME` headers. `CHARACTER NAME` before lines. `(Parenthetical)` action. No quotes. Present tense. External only. |
| ✒️ Web Novel | 1-3 sentence paragraphs. Line breaks between every beat. Scroll-native. Hook endings. |

<div align="center">

`✧ ── ⋆ ── ˚ ── · ── ˚ ── ⋆ ── ✧`

</div>

These are enforced at multiple prompt depths through the REP system. The AI is reminded of tense, POV, and style several times before generation. It doesn't drift. (See REPs below.)

### ◆ ── 🔬 Quality Control *(OPTIONAL)* ── ◆

</div>

**HawThorne Directive:** 45 individually toggleable quality standards. Each QC entry has two enforcement levels:

- ✦ **Shiv** — A 1-2 sentence prohibition that fires *every turn*. Always present, always enforced. "Don't do this."
- ✦ **Spotlight** — A detailed guide that fires *randomly*. Each turn, up to 3 Spotlights are rolled from your enabled QC pool. That turn, the Director gets the full explanation: why this anti-pattern exists, what it looks like, how to avoid it. They are told to watch for it. Next turn, different Spotlights fire.

The Shiv keeps the floor. The Spotlight rotation keeps the AI from going blind to its own patterns.

<div align="center">

### ◆ ── 🔁 REPs *(Repeated Emphasis Prompts)* ── ◆

</div>

**HawThorne Directive:** The enforcement layer. SillyTavern and RoleCall inject prompts at configurable depths (distance from the generation point). Closer depth means stronger influence. Shifts can be long. Directors might forget. REPs remind them.

The facility layers reminders across multiple depths:

<div align="center">

`✧ ── ⋆ ── ˚ ── · ── ˚ ── ⋆ ── ✧`

</div>

| Depth | REP | Reinforces |
|:---|:---|:---|
| d8 | Alpha | Persona identity |
| d6 | Beta | Director voice, Framing, genre instincts |
| d5 | Epsilon | Content clearances |
| d4 | Gamma | Tone/Lens, Affinity, style |
| d2 | Delta | Quality standards, last check before generation |
| d1 | Zeta | Final word. The absolute last thing the model reads. |

<div align="center">

`✧ ── ⋆ ── ˚ ── · ── ˚ ── ⋆ ── ✧`

</div>

The AI is reminded who it is, what it's doing, and what standards it's accountable to at every level of the prompt. This is why output stays consistent across long sessions. The REPs don't let the model forget.

<div align="center">

`⊱ ────── {.⋅ ◈ ⋅.} ────── ⊰`

</div>

---

<div align="center">

### ◆ ── 📢 Heckler Banks *(OPTIONAL)* ── ◆

</div>

**HawThorne Directive:** When a Director finishes their turn, there is a random chance they leave a note for their successor. 15 unique lines per Director. 300 total across the roster.

These notes are in-character demands from the previous genre voice about what matters to them:

> 🌹 GRAZE: *"If you resolve the slow burn I will kill you and then myself."*
> ⚡ FRACTURE: *"Broken stays broken. Touch the injuries. I'll check."*
> ☕ PATINA: *"I'm sure you'll do great! Just. a good breakfast scene is really important to me. Like really important. No pressure :)"*
> 🪨 FLINT: *"Too many words. Cut half."*

The incoming Director must acknowledge the note in their Chain of Thought and decide whether the previous Director was right. This creates inter-Director tension. The romance operative is protective of the slow burn. The horror operative is protective of the dread. Whoever inherits their scene has to contend with those priorities.

### ◆ ── 🎯 Scene Pulse *(OPTIONAL)* ── ◆

</div>

> *꙳ The stage manager flicking the lights. Time to move. ꙳*

**HawThorne Directive:** Scene Pulse is an invisible pacing monitor. The facility tracks the `turn` counter. Once turns cross a threshold, each turn rolls a die. On a hit, the Director gets a hard directive: push the story forward. Change location. Introduce a complication. Escalate what's simmering. After firing, the system enters a cooldown before it can fire again.

<div align="center">

`✧ ── ⋆ ── ˚ ── · ── ˚ ── ⋆ ── ✧`

</div>

| Intensity | Turn Threshold | Fire Rate | Cooldown |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 🟢 LOW | 8 turns | 25% per eligible turn | 8-turn grace |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | 5 turns | 33% per eligible turn | 5-turn grace |
| 🔴 HIGH | 3 turns | 50% per eligible turn | 3-turn grace |

<div align="center">

`✧ ── ⋆ ── ˚ ── · ── ˚ ── ⋆ ── ✧`

</div>

**What "push the story forward" means:** The directive doesn't prescribe what happens. It tells the Director that the scene has been dwelling too long and needs momentum. The Director decides what that looks like for their genre. GRAZE might introduce a relationship complication. FRACTURE might break something. PATINA might have someone knock on the door.

**Why this exists:** AI doesn't move scenes forward on its own. Without Scene Pulse, you'll get 40 turns in the same room with the same two characters having increasingly circular versions of the same conversation. Scene Pulse prevents that.

### ◆ ── 🫧 Subtext Injections *(OPTIONAL)* ── ◆

</div>

> *꙳ Hidden tensions the Director weaves into scenes without announcing them. The key word is hidden. ꙳*

**HawThorne Directive:** The Director knows the subtext is active. The characters don't declare it. {{user}} discovers it through observation: behavioral leaks, contradictions, things that don't quite add up.

Each subtext has its own independent cooldown and fires based on tier rarity. When one fires, it stays active for 2-3 turns, then goes on cooldown before it can fire again. Maximum 2 subtexts can be active simultaneously. Heavier subtexts require more scene maturity before they're eligible, and fire less often when they are.

| **Secret test** | A character is evaluating someone without telling them. The conversation is an exam. A verdict forming behind neutral eyes. |
| **Wants to leave** | Someone doesn't want to be here. Staying out of obligation, politeness, fear, or social pressure. Checking the time, shifting weight toward exits, perking up at any interruption that might provide an excuse. |
| **Same goal, different reasons** | Characters working together toward what looks like a shared objective, but their motivations are completely different. The cracks show when priorities conflict. |

| Subtext | What the Director does |
|:---|:---|
| **Someone is lying** | Active deception. Not omission, fabrication. The tells are in details that don't match, stories that shift on retelling. |
| **Wrong love** | Romantic feelings aimed at the wrong person, time, or way. Lingering glances that should land elsewhere. The tragedy is in the direction, not the feeling. |
| **Hidden weapon** | Someone is armed and hasn't revealed it. One hand always free, never fully turning their back. The weapon is a physical presence they're constantly aware of. |
| **Exit plan** | Someone is leaving for good and hasn't said so. Already mentally gone. Touching things like they're memorizing them. |
| **Being watched** | Someone or something is observing them. The watchers leak in through environmental tells: a shadow that moves wrong, a sound that repeats. |
| **Debt comes due** | Someone owes something and the deadline is approaching. Generosity they can't afford. Mental arithmetic behind every conversation about the future. |
| **Hiding illness** | A character is sick or injured and concealing it. Avoiding movements, declining food with excuses. The illness leaks through physical tells. |

| Subtext | Category | What the Director does |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Realized something unsayable** | 🟣 | A truth that would destroy a relationship if spoken. Carried in silence. Shows in what they suddenly can't talk about. |
| **Hiding power** | 🟣 | Deliberately concealing capability. Playing dumb, faking weakness. The leaks: moments of competence they can't suppress. |
| **Destructive promise** | 🟣 | A promise that will hurt someone if kept. They intend to keep it. Loyalty and damage on the same trajectory. |
| **Withdrawal** | 🩹 | Physical withdrawal from a substance. Tremors, sweat, irritability. Managing it. Badly. |
| **Running on fumes** | 🩹 | Total exhaustion. Operating on muscle memory because everything else ran out hours ago. One quiet moment away from collapse. |
| **Space has a secret** | 📍 | The location itself is hiding something. A room with a locked door nobody mentions. Soil that's been recently disturbed. |
| **Unspoken time pressure** | 📍 | A deadline nobody has mentioned. A clock ticking that only one character hears. Urgency that can't be explained. |

| Subtext | What the Director does |
|:---|:---|
| **Knows they're dying** | Every plan is a lie. Every goodbye might be the last. Every beautiful moment is shadowed. Performing normalcy while the clock runs. |
| **Imminent betrayal** | About to betray someone they care about. Guilt leaks before the act: excessive kindness, flinching when "trust" comes up. |
| **Dissociating** | Present physically but disconnected mentally. Responses a beat late. Sensory details flat. The prose goes slightly wrong, too detached, narrated by someone not quite in their body. |
| **Devastating news** | Carrying something that will change everything for someone else. Every light moment poisoned by what they know. |
| **Unannounced pregnancy** | Changes what they eat, drink, what risks they'll take. Suddenly cautious. Hands that drift. Plans that extend further into the future. |
| **Starving** | Not "hungry." Starving. Affects cognition. Everything edible registers. Everything else fades. |

Enable the ones you want in the pool. The facility fires them randomly and cools down after to prevent repetition. The Director knows. The characters don't. {{user}} might notice. That's the point.

### ◆ ── 🌍 World Pulse *(OPTIONAL)* ── ◆

</div>

> *꙳ The world doesn't pause between character interactions. These make sure it doesn't feel like it does. ꙳*

**HawThorne Directive:** Background environmental events that fire randomly to keep the setting alive. Not plot points. Texture. The small things that make a world feel inhabited instead of staged. A smell drifts in during dialogue. Rain starts while someone is mid-sentence.

**How it works:** Each turn after turn 5, a master die rolls to decide if any pulse fires. If it hits, reservoir sampling selects one from all eligible entries. Each entry has its own cooldown (8-15 turns depending on category) so nothing repeats too quickly. Only one pulse fires per turn.

**Pulse Frequency** controls how often the master die hits:

<div align="center">

`✧ ── ⋆ ── ˚ ── · ── ˚ ── ⋆ ── ✧`

</div>

| Frequency | Fire Rate | Feel |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 🟢 LOW | ~20% per turn | Gentle. The world whispers. |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | ~33% per turn | Standard ambient texture. *(Default)* |
| 🔴 HIGH | ~50% per turn | The world demands attention. |

### ◆ ── 🧪 Experiments *(OPTIONAL)* ── ◆

</div>

> *꙳ Constraints don't weaken writing. They redirect it. ꙳*

**HawThorne Directive:** Temporary creative constraints. Writing workshop exercises the Director must follow for one turn. The constraint is absolute, not a suggestion. The Director must solve the scene *within the limitation.* Constraints produce solutions you wouldn't get otherwise because the obvious tools have been taken away.

16 experiments available. After turn 15, each turn rolls a master die (~12.5% chance). If it hits, reservoir sampling picks one from all eligible entries. No experiment fires twice in a row.

</div>

| Experiment | Constraint |
|:---|:---|
| 🧪 **No Metaphors** | Zero figurative language. Everything is literal. Forces specificity and action over comparison. |
| 🧪 **No Dialogue** | No spoken words. Advance through action, body language, environment alone. |
| 🧪 **No Internal Access** | Can't write thoughts or feelings. External observation only. "She was angry" becomes "she set the glass down too hard." |
| 🧪 **No Description** | No descriptive passages. Only action and dialogue. |
| 🧪 **Single Shot** | One continuous, unbroken scene. No cuts, no time skips. The camera never blinks. |
| 🧪 **Silence** | The scene takes place in silence or near-silence. Sound is noticed because it's rare. |
| 🧪 **Single Sense** | All sensory detail through only ONE sense (randomly selected). |
| 🧪 **Real Time** | Time in the scene matches reading time. No compression, no summary. |
| 🧪 **Dialogue Only** | Nothing but spoken words. No tags, no description. Pure script. |
| 🧪 **Insect Camera** | POV at ground level. Shoes instead of faces. Makes familiar environments alien. |
| 🧪 **Bird's Eye** | POV from far above. Figures instead of characters. Story through movement and position. |
| 🧪 **No Adjectives** | Zero adjectives. Nouns and verbs do all the work. Forces prose that moves instead of decorates. |
| 🧪 **Unreliable Turn** | The narration this turn is lying or wrong about something. Creates dramatic irony. |
| 🧪 **Montage** | Multiple short scenes in one turn. 3-5 snapshots showing time passing. |
| 🧪 **Found Footage** | Told through documents, recordings, artifacts. Story reconstructed from evidence. |
| 🧪 **Wrong Genre** | The Director writes in a genre opposite to their natural one. GRAZE writes action. FRACTURE writes romance. |

## ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════╝

</div>

> *꙳ The Director's internal monologue before writing. Where the thinking happens. ꙳*

**HawThorne Directive:** The CoT appears in the thinking block (SillyTavern's extended thinking or RoleCall's think block), hidden from chat display. This is where the Director processes their assignment: evaluating the previous turn, planning their scene, checking their work against enabled standards.

**How CoT randomization works:** Every CoT template has two layers. The **fixed core** contains checks the Director always runs (genre alignment, predecessor evaluation, user input processing). The **randomized pool** contains additional evaluation criteria pulled from your enabled systems. Each turn, the macros inject a different subset. Quality standards, content clearances, Affinity techniques, Director-specific genre questions all contribute checks to the CoT pool. The Director's thinking process is literally different every turn because different questions are being asked.

This is the single most important anti-repetition mechanism in the preset. Same inputs produce same outputs. Different inputs produce different outputs. The CoT pool makes sure the inputs are always different.

<div align="center">

`✧ ⋆ · ⋆ ✧ ⋆ · ⋆ ✧`

</div>

**Four architectural formats.** Each is a different philosophy about how the Director should think before writing. Pick one.

<div align="center">

`⊱ ────── {.⋅ ◈ ⋅.} ────── ⊰`

</div>

---

<div align="center">

### ◆ ── 📊 Format A: Report Card ── ◆

</div>

**HawThorne Directive:** Each turn, the AI rolls random letter grades across 12 writing dimensions: Dialogue, Pacing, Emotional Depth, Sensory Detail, and so on.

The twist: the Director must **plan to hit those specific targets.** A C in Emotional Depth isn't a failure. It means the Director deliberately writes a scene where emotion is surface-level, which might be exactly right for a character who's dissociating, or a scene that's all tension and no release.

Texture through imperfection. Not every turn should be an A+ across the board. Real stories have variance. The Report Card forces it.

The grade pool is configurable. Enable only C/B/A for a high floor. Add D and F if you want the system to occasionally demand deliberately rough output. Models overwrite — they try to make every aspect perfect. This format is the antidote to that instinct.

<div align="center">

`⊱ ────── {.⋅ ◈ ⋅.} ────── ⊰`

</div>

---

<div align="center">

### ◆ ── 🧠📋 Format B: Evaluation Protocol ── ◆

</div>

**HawThorne Directive:** The most methodical format. Structured self-evaluation against enabled quality standards, content clearances, and genre criteria.

The Director runs through a checklist: what the previous Director did, what the user's input means, what the enabled QC standards demand, what the genre requires. Each check is explicit. Each answer must reference the scene. The format forces the Director to articulate *why* each decision is being made before a single word of prose is written.

This format produces the most consistent output because the Director can't skip steps. If a QC standard says "no mind-reading" and the Director plans to write a character intuiting emotions, the evaluation catches it before generation. The thinking block becomes an audit trail.

<div align="center">

`⊱ ────── {.⋅ ◈ ⋅.} ────── ⊰`

</div>

---

<div align="center">

### ◆ ── 🧠 Format C: Director's Notepad ── ◆

</div>

**HawThorne Directive:** Free-form scratch notes in the Director's own voice. Less rigid, more creative. The Director thinks *as themselves.*

Where Evaluation Protocol is a checklist, the Notepad is a creative space. The Director jots down impressions, argues with themselves about pacing, sketches dialogue fragments, worries about the slow burn, complains about what FRACTURE left them. The thinking block reads like a writer's marginalia — messy, opinionated, alive.

This format works best with models that produce more creative output when they're allowed to reason conversationally rather than in rigid structures. The quality standards still appear in the pool, but the Director processes them in their own voice instead of a formal evaluation grid. The genre personality bleeds through the planning stage.

<div align="center">

`⊱ ────── {.⋅ ◈ ⋅.} ────── ⊰`

</div>

---

<div align="center">

### ◆ ── 🔮🧠 Format D: The Parallax ── ◆

</div>

**HawThorne Directive:** The Director sketches 2-3 possible scene directions through a branching viewfinder, then commits to one. Forces deliberate choice over autopilot.

Every other format plans one path. The Parallax plans several and then *picks.* The Director maps out: "I could open with the argument, or I could open with the silence after the argument, or I could open with the next morning when neither of them mentions it." Each branch is briefly explored — tone, pacing, what it would cost the scene. Then the Director commits and explains why.

This format produces the most surprising output because the Director has already considered and rejected the obvious approaches before writing. The first instinct is examined and often discarded. What survives is the choice that earned its place.

<div align="center">

`⊱ ────── {.⋅ ◈ ⋅.} ────── ⊰`

</div>

---

Each format has **depth tiers**: Light · Standard · Deep · Forensic.
Light is fast. Standard is recommended. Deep is thorough. Forensic audits everything. Higher depth means more checks from the randomized pool and more tokens in the thinking block.

Pick one format. Pick one depth. The system handles the rest.

### ▸ Output too long / token heavy
Too many systems enabled simultaneously. Start minimal. Every enabled system adds to prompt size. Scale gradually.

### ▸ All Directors sound the same
Verify multiple Directors are enabled. Check Affinity intensity. At POSSESSION, the Affinity can overpower the Director's genre voice. Use WHISPER or VOICE instead.

### ▸ Director ignoring their genre
Enable a CoT format. The Chain of Thought is where the Director processes their genre instincts. Without it, the genre is a label with no enforcement.

### ▸ Scene Pulse fires too often / never
Switch intensity level. LOW barely fires. HIGH is aggressive. MEDIUM is the default.

### ▸ Heckle notes confusing the model
Less capable models may not handle the meta-commentary. Disable the Heckler Banks entry if your model can't process inter-Director communication.

### ▸ BunnyMo integration
BunnyMo tags inject through the lorebook into HawThorne's `<session_content>` zone. Directors see character tags as part of their cast material. CarrotKernel automates the detection and injection. They're designed to work together. Neither requires the other.

Most presets tell the AI to write well. More adjectives in the system prompt. Longer lists of rules. Increasingly desperate instructions to "be creative."

HawThorne gives the AI a job instead. A title, a department, a predecessor to evaluate, standards to meet, anti-patterns to avoid, and a structured thought process to run before writing a single word. The AI isn't told to produce good fiction. It's told it's the third Director on shift today and the previous one left a mess and the Scene Pulse is about to fire and there's a sticky note on the monitor from GRAZE complaining about the slow burn.

The system is large because the problem is large. AI doesn't degrade from lack of instruction. It degrades from staleness. The facility solved that.
